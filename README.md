### **Investment Simulator App**

### **Overview**

The Investment Simulator App allows users to create and manage simulated investment portfolios by trading stocks in real-time or simulated market conditions. Users can track performance, view analytics, and compete in challenges. This application showcases full-stack development using Python for the backend and integrates cloud services for scalability and security; also includes machine learning features such as stock price prediction and trade recommendation systems.

### **Key Features**

- **User Accounts and Authentication**
  - Secure login and registration with JWT authentication.
  - Each user has a personal portfolio to manage.

- **Real-Time Market Data**
  - Fetch real-time stock market data via an external API (e.g., [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/), [IEX Cloud](https://iexcloud.io/)).
  - Users can view current and historical stock prices.

- **Stock Price Prediction**
  - Predict future stock prices based on historical data using machine learning models.
  - Models such as Linear Regression and LSTM are used for time-series forecasting.
  - Users can view stock price predictions alongside real-time data to assist in their trading decisions.

- **Trade Recommendation System**
  - Recommend trades based on user portfolio history and market trends.
  - Use collaborative filtering or content-based filtering algorithms to personalize stock recommendations.
  - Help users discover stocks that align with their investment preferences and portfolio performance.

- **Portfolio Management**
  - Users can simulate trades (buy/sell) and view the impact on their portfolio.
  - Track returns, balance, and risk metrics.

- **Performance Analytics**
  - Detailed charts showing portfolio performance over time.
  - Visualize asset allocation and risk metrics.

- **Leaderboards and Challenges**
  - Compete with other users in investment challenges.
  - Track rankings based on portfolio performance.

### **Tech Stack**

#### **Backend (Python)**

- **Flask**: For handling API requests and server-side logic.
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database interactions (using PostgreSQL or SQLite).
- **Celery**: Task queue for handling background tasks (e.g., periodic market data fetching).
- **Redis**: In-memory data store used with Celery for caching and background tasks.
- **Alpha Vantage/IEX Cloud API**: For real-time and historical stock market data integration.
- **scikit-learn** and **TensorFlow/Keras**: For developing stock price prediction models and trade recommendation systems.
- **JWT Authentication**: For user authentication and security.

#### **Frontend (Optional/Expandable)**

- **React or Vue.js**: (If desired) For interactive user interfaces and charting.
- **Chart.js**: For visualizing stock price trends, portfolio performance, and asset allocation.

#### **Database**

- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database to store user accounts, portfolios, transactions, and historical data.
- **Redis**: Used for caching stock data and improving application performance.

#### **Cloud Infrastructure**

- **AWS (or GCP/Azure)**: For hosting the backend and database.
  - **AWS Lambda**: (Optional) To handle certain serverless tasks like trade simulations.
  - **RDS (Relational Database Service)**: Scalable database solution for PostgreSQL.
  - **CloudWatch**: Monitoring the applicationâ€™s health and performance.

#### **CI/CD Pipeline**

- **GitHub Actions**: Automated testing and deployment pipeline.
- **Docker**: Containerization of the app for easy deployment across different environments.

#### **Security**

- **HTTPS**: Secure communication between the client and server.
- **AWS KMS**: Encrypt sensitive data such as user information and transactions.

#### **Performance Optimization**

- **Redis**: For caching API responses to reduce load on external data services.
- **Artillery**: Load testing to ensure scalability and simulate thousands of concurrent users.

### **How to Run Locally**

1. Clone the Repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/investment-simulator-app.git
    cd investment-simulator-app
    ```

2. Install Dependencies
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set Up Environment Variables  
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

    ```
    FLASK_APP=app
    FLASK_ENV=development
    SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
    ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_alpha_vantage_key
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost/dbname
    ```

4. Start Redis and PostgreSQL  
   Ensure Redis and PostgreSQL are running. If using Docker, you can start the services via:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

5. Run the Application
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

6. Celery Worker  
   Start the Celery worker for background tasks (e.g., fetching market data):

    ```bash
    celery -A app.tasks worker --loglevel=info
    ```
